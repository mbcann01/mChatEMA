## Introduction

**The goal of this analysis is to plot participant responses on a circumplex model of affect.**

> "The circumplex model of emotion was developed by James Russell. This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal and valence dimensions. Arousal represents the vertical axis and valence represents the horizontal axis, while the center of the circle represents a neutral valence and a medium level of arousal."

## Methods     

1. We plot each observation on a coordinate plane that represents the circumplex model of affect. In order to do so, we Give each emotional response an x and y value that relates to its quadrant on the CMOA chart.

    + Happy: Sits directly on the positive x-axis
    
    + Sad: Sits directly on the negative x-axis
    
    + Excited: Quadrant 1 (upper right)
    
    + Restless: Quadrant 2 (upper left)
    
    + Bored: Quadrant 3 (lower left)
    
    + Calm: Quadrant 4 (lower right)   
    
2. The CMOA plots also account for the strength with which the participant felt that emotion.

    + Strongly Agree = (-)4
    
    + Agree = (-)3
    
    + Neutral = (-)2
    
    + Disagree = (-)1
    
    + Strongly Disagree = 0
    
3. Examples

    + Happy is directly on the x-axis between quadrants 1 and 4. Its y value is fixed at zero, and its x value is allowed to fall between 0 and positive 4. If the participant Strongly agrees that they feel happy then their coordinates are (4, 0) for that observation. If the participant is neutral about feeling happy then their coordinates are (2, 0) for that observation. If the participant Strongly disagrees that they feel happy then their coordinates are (0, 0) for that observation.
    
    + Restless is in quadrant 2. Its x value is allowed to fall between 0 and negative 4, and its y value is allowed to range between 0 and positive 4. If the participant Strongly agrees that they feel restless then their coordinates are (-4, 4) for that observation. If the participant is neutral about feeling restless then their coordinates are (-2, 2) for that observation. If the participant Strongly disagrees that they feel restless then their coordinates are (0, 0) for that observation.
    
4. We create emotional summary scores by summing the x values for all emotions listed under bullet 2 above into a composite x value, and by summing the y values for all emotions listed under bullet 2 above into a composite y value. For example, consider the values for a hypothetical participant in a given observation: 

* X values:
    + Happy = 3
    + Sad = 0
    + Restless = 0
    + Excited = 0
    + Calm = 3
    + Bored = 0
    
* Y values:
    + Happy = 0 
    + Sad = 0
    + Restless = 0
    + Excited = 0
    + Calm = -3
    + Bored = 0
    
* The composite emotion coordinates for this observation are (6, -3).
    
5. Below we plot the relationship between immediate emotion and behaviors in the same day. Specifically we plot the relationship between emotion and:

    + What they were doing right before they took the assessment: other_act, sit_act, sleep_act, stand_act, walk_act, talk_act
    
    + Physical activity: bike_yest, run_yest, cleaning_yest, non_yest, min_walk_c, min_run_c, min_act_c, min_sit_c, 
    
    + Substance use: alc_sub, cig_sub, mar_sub, opi_sub, stim_sub, herb_sub, other_sub, none_sub
